1.)This Repository holds the Global Portfolio which I made for my final year project in an Excel Doc. (xlsx). The question was: 

Question 4 – Applied Portfolio Management
As a portfolio manager in a private bank, you have been asked to build a portfolio for a new client. This
client has €10 million to invest, is 30 years old, with a tolerance for higher risk assets. The client also has an
interest in investing in some recent trends, including innovation, ESG funds, and emerging markets.
Your supervisor has advised to use a portfolio of ETFs to achieve this client mandate. In addition, you are
advised to use a 80/10/10 asset allocation between equities, bonds, and alternatives. In addition, you have
to stay within an annual total expense ratio of 0.50%.

Required:

(a) Design an appropriate global portfolio to meet the above criteria. Using an Excel spreadsheet,
clearly show your euro allocation and expense ratio for each ETF chosen. (20 marks)

(b) Write a short report to your supervisor to explain the process by which you selected the ETFs and
the logic of the final asset allocation. (13.3 marks)
Total 33.3 marks



2.) It also contains an Equirty Research analysis proeject which is attached as a PDF. I did this project on AMD and recommneded a buy. The stock has thrived since.
